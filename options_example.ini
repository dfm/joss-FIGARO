This is an example config file for the various FIGARO command line scripts. Model your ini file after this one (please remember the [DEFAULT] section).
You're not required to provide all the various options: the only required ones are input and bounds.All the others, if not provided, will fall back to default values. Options that are not listed here will be ignored, but no warning message will be displayed.
Any command-line option will override the corresponding one provided in the config file.
